# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs

## Role Assignment and Responsibility Definition
When assigning team roles and responsibilities during project planning:
- Review the [OctoAcme Roles and Personas](./octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) document to understand available roles and their interactions
- Use the [Role Definition Checklist](./templates/role-definition-checklist.md) template to document new or project-specific roles
- For onboarding team members into their roles, refer to the [Role Onboarding Template](./templates/role-onboarding-template.md)
- Consider creating a RACI matrix for key project activities to clarify accountability
